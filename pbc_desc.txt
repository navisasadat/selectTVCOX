Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

A nearly identical data set found in appendix D of Fleming and Harrington.
The differences with this data set are:
  age is in days, status is coded with 3 levels, and
  the sex and stage variables are not missing for obs 313-418.

The data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) 
of the liver conducted between 1974 and 1984.  A total of 424 PBC patients, 
referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year interval, met eligibility 
criteria for the randomized placebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine.  
The first 312 cases in the data set participated in the randomized trial and 
contain largely complete data.  The additional 112 cases did not participate 
in the clinical trial, but consented to have basic measurements recorded and 
to be followed for survival.  Six of those cases were lost to follow-up shortly 
after diagnosis, so the data here are on an additional 106 cases as well as 
the 312 randomized participants. Missing data items are denoted by a period.
